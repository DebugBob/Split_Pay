#Split Pay

##Description:
Splitting bills with friends can be a pain, especially when you have to factor in taxes and tips. 
Split Pay solves this problem by automating the calculations and ensuring everyone pays their fair share.
Working on this project improved our skills in designing apps that are easy to use and look good on any screen.
We learned how to make it responsive, handle user input effectively, and save data for a better experience.

Add items and participants using the “Add Value” and “Add Person” buttons, respectively. These will populate underneath as cards.
Clicking a card's X button deletes the card.
Hover over buttons and cards to experience interactive color changes for enhanced user experience.
After adding all items and participants, click "Calculate" to get a confirmation modal with back and confirm buttons. The modal will display the itemized total , factoring in a 10% tip if required.
Clicking back closes the modal.
Clicking confirm takes you to a page to see total, list of items and prices, list of names and respective splits.
